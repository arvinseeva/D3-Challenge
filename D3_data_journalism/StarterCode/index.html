            <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Obesity, Smoking and Lack of Healthcare Against Poverty, Age and Median Income</h2>
            <p></p>
            <h3>Understanding Obesity</h3>
            
            <p>From this chart, Arkansas, West Virginia and Mississippi has the most obese populous. Families that are living in
              poverty and low-income are most likely to be obese. This is also more evident in the middle-aged group. We can conclude that 
              finances are a driver in obesity. Low income or poverty leads to poor diet and subsequently obesity over long time. 
            </p>

            <h3>Understanding Smoking</h3>
  
            <p>The state with the highest number of smokers are West Virginia and Kentucky. The evidence shows that poverty or 
              low income leads to smoking. It is interesting to observe that the smokers in these states are also older with the median age around the 40s.
            </p>

            <h3>Understanding Lack of Healthcare</h3>
  
            <p>TThe lonestar state takes the lead with lack of healthcare. It is observed that Texans with low income or living in poverty 
              do not invest in healthcare. It is also evident in the relatively younger population.
